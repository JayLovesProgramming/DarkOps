# HELL ENGINE

<!-- December 27 2023 -->
This codebase began as a CPU raycaster to explore the viability of a voxel based idea I had for global illumination. 
The voxel idea didn't work out in the end, the voxel grid caused lighting artefacts, but rewriting it to use a pointcloud did and here we are. 
This is now the new Hell Engine, the engine I'm writing to house a splitscreen roguelike/deathmatch survival horror game.

## Contribution
This project is currently a one-person endeavor, but I welcome contributions and collaboration! If you're interested in learning more about game engine development or would like to contribute to this game engine, please reach out to me via Discord: **@jw_uk**. Together, we can build a powerful game engine and share knowledge within the community.

## Roadmap
- Expand documentation for contributors, including setup instructions and coding guidelines.
- Establish a community forum or Discord channel for discussions, feedback, and sharing resources.
- Prioritize the implementation of the ECS and networking components to enable multiplayer support.
